# About
This application is a simple web client that interacts with the Philips Hue Bridge server and can therefore control all devices attached to the Smart Bridge. This application was created to perform user tests involving light change and motion. After connecting successfully you should be able to turn blue lights on (matching the screen color of the device used for testing) after clicking the green button on the website and have the lights respond to the motion of the smartphone.


## Installation

Replace the URL in the code with your private API key from Philips and the IP address of the Smart Hub in your local network and make sure the device you are using is in connected to the same network as the Smart Bridge.

No installation required. After making the changes mentioned above just open the page and start controlling the lights.
