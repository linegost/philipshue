About
A colour synchronization between a LED light on a Arduino and a mobile device. The initial screen presents hotelâ€™s wi-fi connection, then a screen appears when the wi-fi is connected that shows a short color animation similar to the lights shown by the arduino (in the low-fi version there is only one color shown). The light is timed together with the screen to show for 7 seconds.
