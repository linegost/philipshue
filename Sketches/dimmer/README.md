# About

A brightness synchronization between a LED light on a Arduino and a mobile device. 
The initial screen presents hotelâ€™s wi-fi connection, then a new screen appears when the wi-fi is connected. 
On the new screen, the background color changes simultaneously with the brightness of the LED. 
The LED slowly dims down and up in duration of 6 seconds.
